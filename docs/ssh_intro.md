# SSH Introduction 

SSH also stands for secure shell. It is a protocol used to secure a connection between a client and a server. 


## History

The Secure Shell protocol was originally developed by Tatu Ylonen in 1995 in response to a hacking incident in the Finnish university network. A password sniffer had been installed on a server connected directly to the backbone, and when it was discovered, it had thousands of usernames and passwords in its database, including several from Ylonen's company.

That incident triggered Ylonen to study cryptography and develop a solution he could use himself for remote login over the Internet safely. His friends proposed additional features, and three months later, in July 1995, Ylonen published the first version as open source. It became OpenSSH. Later he took the protocol for standardization at the IETF and designed the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). He founded SSH Communications Security Corp in December 1995 to provide commercial support for the protocol.
